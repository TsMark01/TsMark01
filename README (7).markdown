## 📖 About Me

I'm a 17-year-old Computer Science enthusiast from Russia, passionate about **data engineering**, **automation**, and building cool projects. I love creating tools that make data work smarter—whether it's crafting ETL pipelines, designing Telegram bots, or teaching others through mini-courses. Currently, I'm diving deep into Python, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and more, with 6+ projects on GitHub showcasing my skills.

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new tech, dreaming up innovative solutions, or sharing my knowledge with the community. Let's build the future of data together! 💻
